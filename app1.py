st.info("The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), is the largest public housing authority in North America, was created in 1935 to provide decent, affordable housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. There has been a steady decline in federal and state funding for NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) since 1998. The purpose of this project is to analyze the services that are the most impactful and used by public housing residents. This will demonstrate which services should receive more funding since they benefit more residents. Based on this, my hypothesis was that since NYCHAâ€™s funding is plummeting, fewer residents are receiving the help they need through the services and programs that are available specifically for NYCHA residents. I use datasets from NYC Open Data to collect information on various different programs/services provided to NYCHA residents: SNAP(The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Cash Assistance, Workforce 1, and some financial services. Links and more information to these data sources can be found under â€˜CITATIONSâ€™ and â€˜Data Usedâ€™. I mainly used streamlit, plotly, and matplotlib to make statistical analysis and run Linear fit trend lines on each program/service listed above. I look through the number of residents that enroll in a specific service each year and for some, how many of them reported to have benefited from that service/program. In the end, we see that the services that are most used (SNAP and Cash Assistance) are declining over the years. We also see that from all of the financial services available, the Empowerment Center Program is most beneficial to NYCHA residents. ")

Each row in the dataset represents the number of public housing residents on a NYCHA Development-level who receive or utilize this service.

            2) SNAP and Cash Assistance for NYCHA Residents (CSV Data Format) :
            This dataset contains information about SNAP and Cash Assistance, services offered by the Department of Social Services (DSS)/Human Resources Administration (HRA) to help New Yorkers receive the federally-administered food benefits they qualify for. Each row in the dataset represents the number of public housing residents on a Borough-level who receive or utilize this service.

            3) Workforce 1 for NYCHA Residents by Borough (CSV Data Format):
            This dataset contains information about the Workforce 1 service, a service offered by the Department of Small Business Services (SBS) that connects New Yorkers to job opportunities. Each row in the dataset represents the number of public housing residents on a Borough-level who receive or utilize this service and how many of them were placed in full-time or part-time jobs.

            5) 2017-18 Financial Services for NYCHA Residents by Borough (CSV Data Format):

            These 2 datasets contain information about NYCHA residentsâ€™ use of:

            a) NYC Financial Empowerment Centers: a program that provides free, one-on-one professional financial counseling and coaching to all NYC residents. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service;

            b) EmpoweredNYC: is an initiative to assist New Yorkers with disabilities and their families to better manage their finances and become more financially stable. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service;


            c) Residents CAN!: a program that provided free professional and peer-to-peer financial counseling and coaching to residents in targeted NYCHA developments;

            d) La Ventanilla: a program that helps connect the Mexican community in New York City to financial counseling and coaching, as well as Free Tax Preparation services


            e) Student Loan Debt clinic: is an initiative to help New Yorkers understand their student loans and how to repay them. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service; and

            f) Ready to Rent: a program providing free one-on-one financial counseling to New Yorkers seeking to apply for affordable housing units through HPDâ€™s Housing Connect lottery. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service.

            This also contains information on whether or not these programs benefited them through increased credit scores and/or receiving financial counseling.

With the bar graphs, I used statistical analysis of the datasets to get the sum of each serviceâ€™s enrollment per year. With some datasets, I was able to do the same to get the number of residents that reported the service to be beneficial. I also did some comparisons between the number of residents who applied vs the number that were accepted and enrolled in the program. 
With the pie charts, I used Statistical analysis by finding the mean of each service/programâ€™s enrollment for the 2-4 years, normalizing them, and visualizing it with pie charts. One shows the enrollment percentage for the 5 programs and services and the other shows the enrollment breakdown for the financial services. 
With the scatter plot line trend graph, I used Linear regression models to show the declining trend of enrollment of the services/programs.

            By grouping the enrollment for each service by year we can see that most of the Services
            and Programs have been declining yearly. The linear trends for each service/program also showcase this.
            SNAP and Cash Assistance programs have the highest enrollment, while Summer Youth, Financial Services, and Workforce 1 do 
            not have data to show for past 2019. However, those 3 services were the only ones to have an enrollment increase between a year 
            or two. Financial services and Workforce 1 have a significant decrease in enrollment in  2018. This could mean that the services 
            were not as available to residents due to budget cutbacks. In 2019, you see the enrollments spike up again, showing that 
            these services are useful to the residents.
