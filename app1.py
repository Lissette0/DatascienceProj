st.info("""The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the largest public housing authority in North America, was established in 1935 with the mission of providing decent, affordable housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. However, over the years, there has been a concerning trend of decreasing federal and state funding allocated to NYCHA, beginning in 1998.

The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the services provided by NYCHA that have the greatest impact on and utilization by public housing residents. By identifying these critical services, I advocate for increased funding to ensure that residents receive the support they need.

Drawing upon datasets from NYC Open Data, I examine various programs and services available to NYCHA residents, including SNAP (The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Cash Assistance, Workforce 1, and several financial services. For detailed information and data sources, please refer to the 'CITATIONS' and 'Data Used' sections.

My analysis employs tools such as Streamlit, Plotly, and Matplotlib to conduct statistical analyses and visualize trends. I utilize linear fit trend lines to assess the trajectory of each program or service over time. Specifically, I evaluate the annual enrollment rates in specific services and, in some cases, the reported benefits received by participants.

My findings reveal concerning trends: notably, the utilization of critical services such as SNAP and Cash Assistance is declining over the years. Furthermore, among the array of financial services offered, the Empowerment Center Program emerges as particularly beneficial to NYCHA residents.

In conclusion, this analysis underscores the urgent need for increased support and funding for NYCHA. By prioritizing resources towards the most impactful services, I aim to ensure that NYCHA residents receive the assistance necessary to thrive. """)

            a) NYC Financial Empowerment Centers: a program that provides free, one-on-one professional financial counseling and coaching to all NYC residents. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service;

            b) EmpoweredNYC: is an initiative to assist New Yorkers with disabilities and their families to better manage their finances and become more financially stable. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service;


            c) Residents CAN!: a program that provided free professional and peer-to-peer financial counseling and coaching to residents in targeted NYCHA developments;

            d) La Ventanilla: a program that helps connect the Mexican community in New York City to financial counseling and coaching, as well as Free Tax Preparation services

            f) Ready to Rent: a program providing free one-on-one financial counseling to New Yorkers seeking to apply for affordable housing units through HPDâ€™s Housing Connect lottery. Each row in the dataset represents the number of NYCHA residents on a Borough-level who utilized this service.

st.subheader('Techniques')
st.info("""
In analyzing the data for my data science project, I employed several techniques to enhance clarity and insight. Utilizing statistical analysis, I computed the total enrollment for each service annually, providing a comprehensive view of enrollment trends. Furthermore, for select datasets, I delved deeper, determining the count of residents reporting service benefits, enriching our understanding of user satisfaction.

In addition, I conducted comparisons between the number of applicants and those successfully enrolled, shedding light on program acceptance rates. Leveraging statistical methods, I calculated the mean enrollment for services over multiple years, normalizing the data for better comparison. This culminated in the creation of pie charts illustrating enrollment percentages across different programs, offering a succinct visual representation of the data.

Moreover, I segmented the analysis further, presenting a breakdown of enrollment specifically within financial services, allowing for focused insights. Finally, employing linear regression models, I depicted the declining enrollment trends of various services over time, providing valuable predictive insights into future enrollment patterns.

         These charts show the percentage of enrollment for each Service/program. On the first chart, 'SNAP', 'Cash Assistance' and
         'Workforce 1' has the highest enrollment rates. 'Financial Services' is of very low percentage so I broke down the services that fall 
         under it on the hart to the right. Here we can tell that the financial services with the most enrollment are 'Empowerment Center Program', 'Residents CAN!', and 'Ready to Rent'. 
         This tells us that these services are in high demand, on top of that these services were also reported as most beneficial to the residents. Therefore funding should go to these 
         programs (or programs similar to this) for NYCHA residents.

            By grouping the enrollment for each service by year we can see that most of the Services
            and Programs have been declining yearly. The linear trends for each service/program also showcase this.
            SNAP and Cash Assistance programs have the highest enrollment, while Summer Youth, Financial Services, and Workforce 1 do 
            not have data to show for past 2019. However, those 3 services were the only ones to have an enrollment increase between a year 
            or two. Financial services and Workforce 1 have a significant decrease in enrollment in  2018. This could mean that the services 
            were not as available to residents due to budget cutbacks. In 2019, you see the enrollments spike up again, showing that 
            these services are useful to the residents.
